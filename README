-------------------------

== Description

This extension allows for different page parts to be rendered
depending on the user's Accept-Language header.

== Disclaimer

This extension works well for me, but YMMV.

== Dependencies

* None, really

== Usage

In the pages you wish to have different languages available,
simply create a page part with a two letter language abbreviation
suffix for every part you wish to have available in multiple languages.

NOTE: the default language is english, so page parts without the
two-letter language suffix will be considered english.

Examples:
---------
Page Parts:
  'body' (English)
  'body_de' (German translation)
  'body_fr' (French translation)
  
  'sidebar' (English)
  'sidebar_de' (German translation)
  'sidebar_fr' (French translation)

Then, in your layout, simply use the translator tags the same way you would use the standard Radiant content tag

<r:translator:content name="body" />
<r:translator:content name="sidebar" inherit="true" />

each of these will render the appropriate page part, determined by the browser's Accept-Language
